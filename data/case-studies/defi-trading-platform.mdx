## Objective

GitCoin Grants wanted a smoother, more reliable UX for **cross-chain donations**-while staying true to the project’s values of **low fees, low trust, and multi-chain openness**.

Raid Guild (with contributions from 0xSero) was tasked with researching and testing bridging options to support AlloV2 chains and real donor behavior.

## Project Constraints

From conversations with stakeholders, the constraints were clear:

1. **Cost-Effective** – Donation flows must remain accessible to small donors.
2. **Trust-Minimized** – Avoid centralized, opaque trust assumptions wherever possible.
3. **Multi-Chain Compatible** – Support all AlloV2 chains (except PGN).
4. **Native + Stablecoins** – Prioritize common, liquid tokens.
5. **Transparent** – Preserve the ability to track donor information (e.g. `msg.sender`).

## Process

### Phase 1 – Research

The team evaluated multiple bridging options against the constraints.

**Considered:**

- **Connext**
- **Li.Fi**
- **Decent**

**Excluded:**

- **CCIP** – limited chain coverage.
- **LayerZero** – bridging only, no liquidity layer.
- **Stargate** – only via Li.Fi wrappers.

> Insight: Every option had trade‑offs. Connext, for instance, lacked Fantom support, which mattered for some AlloV2 deployments.

### Phase 2 – Testing

Research moved quickly into hands-on testing with **simulated and real‑world scenarios**.

1. **Mock Contracts**

   - A `CrossChainAdapterContract` and `MockAllo` were deployed to **Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism**.
   - These mimicked the core donation flow.

2. **Simulation Tools**

   - **Tenderly Forks** to replicate chain environments and make tests reproducible.
   - **CLI scripts** to automate bridge API calls with fixed transaction data.
   - **Google Sheets** to log and compare results.

3. **Real Data**
   - Test data from a real grants round was used to reflect actual donor patterns.

## Findings

### Solution Comparison

| Feature                 | Li.Fi             | Decent         | Connext            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Avg. Cost (L2↔L2)       | $5.66             | $5.00          | **$4.04**          |
| Chains Supported        | 20+               | 10+            | 10+                |
| Integration Style       | API + Frontend    | API + Frontend | **Contract-Based** |
| Operational History     | 2.5 years         | 1 year         | **7 years**        |
| Insurance               | Yes (via bridges) | No             | No                 |
| PoC Implementation Time | 1 day             | Incomplete     | **1 day**          |

#### Cost Analysis

| Solution    | Avg. Cost (Simulated) | Avg. Cost (Manual) | Transaction Efficiency |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Connext** | **$4.04**             | $6.96              | ~98%                   |
| **Li.Fi**   | $5.66                 | $1.72              | ~99.5%                 |
| **Decent**  | $5.00                 | $5.00              | N/A                    |

**Observations:**

- Connext offered **lowest simulated costs** and very debuggable, contract-centric integrations.
- Li.Fi provided **excellent chain coverage** and strong routing but slightly higher costs.
- Decent’s tooling and documentation were not yet mature enough for production in this timeframe.

## Challenges

1. **Chain-Specific Quirks** – For example, intermittent failures on Arbitrum via Li.Fi despite identical configs.
2. **Automation Gaps** – Not all bridge APIs were equally automation‑friendly under the tight deadline.
3. **Cost vs. Trust** – Batch bridging reduced costs but introduced additional trust assumptions.

## Proposed Architectures

### 1. Per-Donation Bridging

- Each donation is bridged individually.
- Pros: Best for **decentralization and transparency**.
- Cons: Higher per‑tx costs.

### 2. Batch Bridging

- Donations aggregate into a multi-sig and bridge periodically.
- Pros: Lower fees, potential operational efficiency.
- Cons: More trust, more operational complexity.

## Recommendations

### Short-Term

- **Connext**

  - Great candidate for an initial implementation: low cost, mature stack, and simple debugging.
  - Option to run a custom router for fee capture.

- **Li.Fi**
  - Strong choice for projects that value broad chain support, flexible routing, and insurance.

### Long-Term

- Explore **xERC20** patterns for more native, low-slippage cross-chain assets.
- Track the evolution of **Decent** as its ecosystem matures.

## Learnings & Next Steps

1. **API Quality Matters** – Connext’s mature tooling accelerated implementation; gaps slowed others down.
2. **L2s Are the Sweet Spot** – More predictable costs and speeds on L2s reinforced focusing there.
3. **Testing Depth** – Future work should expand datasets and refine automation to surface subtler behaviors.

**Next steps proposed to GitCoin Grants:**

- Decide on an initial bridge partner (likely Connext or Li.Fi).
- Build a more exhaustive, automated evaluation harness for future comparisons.
- Publish findings to help the broader grants/donations ecosystem.

This case study shows the kind of **pragmatic, research-heavy engineering work** that 0xSero brings: deep comparison of options, realistic testing, and clear trade-off analysis rather than chasing hype.
