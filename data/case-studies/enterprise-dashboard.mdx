## Problem

The ZKSync & Ethereum Governance Event Monitor project aimed to create a transparent, scalable, and efficient monitoring system for governance-related events on ZKSync Era and Ethereum Mainnet. By transforming blockchain events into structured RSS feeds, this solution provides stakeholders and developers with accessible and real-time insights into governance activities.

The collaboration with ScopeLift ensured a robust design and seamless implementation within a tight one-month timeline, leveraging cutting-edge technologies and best practices for scalable, cloud-based deployments.

## Objectives

1. **Governance Event Tracking**: Capture and process governance-related blockchain events, including proposal creation, execution, cancellation, and administrative changes.
2. **RSS Feed Integration**: Present event data through user-friendly, regularly updated RSS feeds.
3. **Scalable and Reliable Architecture**: Utilize Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Docker for deployment, ensuring scalability and reliability.
4. **Transparent Monitoring**: Provide structured and archived historical data for long-term accessibility.

## Solution

The project utilized a modular, cloud-based architecture, encompassing blockchain networks, backend services, storage, and frontend components.

### Key Features

- **Event Detection**: Monitors and processes governance events in batches for efficiency.
- **RSS Feed Updates**: Automatically generates and updates feeds with new events while archiving old entries for transparency.
- **Scalability**: Supports large-scale RPC usage with over 150,000 daily calls across Ethereum Mainnet and ZKSync Era.

### Core Functionalities

**1. Event Monitoring**

- Captures governance-related events such as proposal creation, execution, and cancellations.
- Supports multiple blockchains: Ethereum Mainnet and ZKSync Era.

**2. RSS Feed Integration**

- RSS feeds allow users to track events in real-time.
- Archived RSS entries ensure historical data remains accessible.

**3. Infrastructure**

- Cloud Platform: GCP for reliable and scalable storage.
- Containerization: Docker for consistent deployment.
- Frontend Framework: Next.js for user-facing interactions.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Tight Timeline

**Challenge**: Completing the project within one month required efficient task allocation and rapid prototyping.

**Solution**: A well-defined roadmap and daily syncs with ScopeLift ensured alignment and progress.

### High RPC Usage

**Challenge**: Balancing extensive RPC calls with network rate limits.

**Solution**: Batch processing with optimized parameters reduced redundant calls while maintaining performance.

### Scalability

**Challenge**: Ensuring scalability for increasing event volumes and user access.

**Solution**: GCP's scalable storage and processing capabilities allowed seamless handling of large data volumes.

### Error Handling

**Challenge**: Managing transient and permanent errors in blockchain data retrieval.

**Solution**: A robust error handling mechanism with retry logic and alerting ensured uninterrupted operation.

## Results

1. **Functional Monitoring System**

   - Real-time event monitoring for Ethereum and ZKSync governance activities.
   - Seamless RSS feed updates with archived data storage.

2. **Scalable Architecture**

   - GCP and Docker ensured the system could handle high traffic and data volumes.

3. **Stakeholder Value**

   - Simplified tracking of governance events enhanced transparency and accessibility for developers and users.

4. **Efficient Development**
   - Delivered on time with all features fully functional, showcasing effective collaboration and execution.
