## A place for artist to create and grow together.

Marketing is the key to success of any product, but it's often the most difficult part of growing a business.
With over _5 billion_ people using the internet there's a lot of opportunity to grow, but there's also competition for these opportunities.
A study showed that information paired with an image improved people's retention of that content from 10% after 3 days, up to 65%.

Our platform allows writers, content creators, and media users to market themselves with the assistance of text-to-image AI technology. Creators
Can upload or link their content and sponsor platform users to generate unique artwork for marketing after viewing said content.
To ensure that creators and platform users are both incentivized, the winners artwork will be minted to an NFT collection, giving recognition and a percentage of earnings to both the sponsors and the users.

**We can categorize our users as:**

1. Creators/Sponsors
2. AI artist/platform users

### AI as a tool to visualize content and boost growth.

Unique art is eye-catching, exciting, and memorable, but it's also difficult to create for most people. This puts businesses and creators who rely on video, audio and written text at a disadvantage. It's been well recorded how important banner art is for building and engaging an audience.

We can leverage image-generating AI to create captivating, unique and impactful art using text collected from content and user-provided information. Those without artistic background can now easily sponsor the creation of original art relevant to their needs for marketing, and adding a special twist to their work.

**Usecases for the generated art include:**

- Profile pictures and banners
- Book and cover art
- Badges for rewarding community
- Music album covers
- Social media marketing
- Thumbnails, channel art, personas
- Music videos
- Memes

### Using NFTs to give artists and sponsors the recognition they deserve

Most artists would argue that they are not given the right compensation and recognition for their art. The internet has been known to use content without giving credit, often leaving the creators with not much to show for their work while the art has millions of views and downloads. NFTs help mitigate this problem, it is a standard that most tech giants are now adopting and incorporating into their platforms.

All winner collections will be minted onto the blockchain and viewable in our application. The creators will be credited and they will earn a royalty fee for the legal use and sale of their art. While sponsors get the NFT to prove ownership and provide protection for the content they paid to have created.

**Usecases for the NFTs include:**

- Proof of work token for platform users
- A portfolio of art generated for users
- Content protection for both sponsors and users
- A marketing strategy
- Community building and token gating
- Censorship resistant art

### Why?

We want to give everyone the opportunity to create captivating and useful content regardless of their artistic background. To own the content they create, and to get the credit they deserve for their work.
