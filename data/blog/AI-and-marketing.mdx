## Context

In mid-2022, I built a prototype for an AI-powered creative tool aimed at content creators. The idea was straightforward: let writers and podcasters generate custom artwork for their content using text-to-image models, without needing design skills.

This was before Midjourney went mainstream and DALL-E 3 shipped. The tooling was rough. Stable Diffusion had just come out, and running inference locally meant wrestling with CUDA drivers and VRAM limits.

## What we built

The platform let creators:

- Paste their content (article, script, podcast transcript)
- Extract key themes and visual concepts
- Generate images based on those themes
- Iterate with prompt refinement

We also experimented with on-chain attribution using NFTs—the idea being that creators could prove provenance and potentially earn royalties on derivative use.

## What worked

**AI image generation as a creative starting point.** Most creators aren't looking for finished art. They want something to react to, to iterate on. The AI output served as a draft that could be refined or handed to a designer.

**Extracting visual concepts from text.** Running content through a summarization step before image generation improved results significantly. Raw text-to-image prompts are noisy. Structured extraction helps.

**Low barrier to entry.** People who would never open Photoshop were willing to try a tool that felt like a form.

## What didn't

**NFT complexity.** The overhead of wallets, gas fees, and blockchain concepts was a barrier for non-crypto-native users. Most creators just wanted the image, not on-chain proof.

**Inference costs.** Running image generation at scale in 2022 was expensive. The unit economics didn't work for a consumer product without significant funding.

**Timing.** Six months later, free tools with better models flooded the market. The moat we thought we had evaporated.

## Takeaways

1. **Build for the workflow, not the technology.** Creators don't care about diffusion models or NFT standards. They care about getting their newsletter out on time with decent visuals.

2. **Moats in AI are temporary.** If your value proposition is "access to a model," you're competing with OpenAI's next API release.

3. **Crypto UX still isn't there.** On-chain attribution is a compelling concept, but the friction cost is real. Until wallets are invisible, adoption will be limited to crypto-native users.

4. **Prototype fast, but know when to stop.** We spent too long polishing features for a market that was about to get disrupted. Shipping earlier would have given us faster signal.

This project didn't become a business, but it shaped how I think about building at the intersection of AI and creative tools. The underlying problems—attribution, provenance, creator economics—are still unsolved. The solutions just look different now.
