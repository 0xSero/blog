## Time is precious

In our industry staying ahead means you have to give a lot of time researching new tech, learning languages, and having conversations with coworkers.

On top of that, you also have to market yourself if you're a freelancer or hit your quotas if you're already employed.

### How can we save our time?

When I landed some clients and my career started kicking off I quickly realised that developing and maintaining projects is a huge time investment, everything felt chaotic and my goals seemed out of reach.

To understand why I was struggling and how to solve the problem I made it my mission to reach out to senior developers, business people, project managers and professionals in tech.
More often than not people sympathised with this issue and I would get recommended an agile-based framework called SCRUM.

### What is Scrum?

Scrum is a philosophy built around time and resource management. Whatever you want to create whether it be a creating a website, launching a startup or learning a new technology stack it is beneficial to approach your goals by treating them like a project.

Scrum recommends that these values be upheld for the success of the project:

1. **Transparency**: Everyone involved in the project must maintain complete transparency in all their work. They have to trust, and encourage each other to hit their goals. Even if you work alone there is a benefit to writing things down on paper and having a discussion with your self.

2. **Inspection**: To learn you must gain insight into what you've done, this builds on the first pillar. We look back at our work objectively, and make assessments of our performance and quality of work. We then collect feedback around all of our actions and interactions, and we keep an open mind even to criticism.

3. **Adaptation**: Continuous improvement is the final pillar, the ability to grow based on what you learned during inspection is what makes all your work ultimately worthwhile, regardless of whether or not you failed at the end of the day you documented your wrongs, and learned how to make them right. Now you won't spend time on something pointless, and the mistakes you've made become part of your success.
   By adapting you offer your clients, friends, and users constant improvements, keeping them around for just one more day, every single day.

### Conclusions

Work is difficult and life is short, you have to treat each day like it's a gift. There is value in every situation as long as you stay honest, open-minded, and adaptive.
