I am a Web-3 Software Engineer, podcaster and writer with a working presence in the United States, United Kingdom and Poland. I've had experience working on launching startups, upgrading existing web infrastructure and consulting for Public-Private-relation and social impact organizations.

I also work with online creators to help protect their public image by removing stolen content, doxxed information and fake accounts from search engines, social media applications and malicious websites.

When I'm not working on projects I like to educate myself on computer science and blockchain technology, hosting local meetups, working out, and spending time with my family.
