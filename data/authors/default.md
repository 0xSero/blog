I am a proud father, Software Engineer, writer, and podcaster. I'm deeply invested in the web3 space, open source, and freedom technology.

I work with online creators to help protect their public image by removing stolen content, doxxed information and fake accounts from search engines, social media applications and malicious websites.

When I'm not working on projects I like to read books, host local meetups, working out, and spending time with my family.
