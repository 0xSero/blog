## I build tools that protect people.

That's the thread running through everything I do—whether it's AI agents, blockchain infrastructure, or the content protection work I started with years ago.

I'm a father first. That changed how I see technology. Before, I built things because they were interesting. Now I build things because my kid is going to inherit this internet, and I'd like it to be less predatory.

## The Origin Story

I didn't start in crypto or AI. I started helping online creators—artists, streamers, influencers—remove stolen content, fake accounts, and doxxed information from the web. DMCA takedowns, GDPR requests, hunting down impersonators. Tedious, unglamorous work that most people don't even know is possible.

That work taught me something: **the systems we build shape who has power.** A scammer with the right tools can ruin someone's life in an afternoon. A creator with the right tools can take it back.

So I started building tools.

## What I Actually Do

**AI Infrastructure** — I contribute to [ElizaOS](https://elizaos.ai), the autonomous agents framework with 17k+ stars and 580 contributors. I build orchestration layers, memory systems, and the boring plumbing that makes AI agents actually work in production. My project [Open Orchestra](https://github.com/0xSero/open-orchestra) handles multi-agent coordination with Neo4j-backed memory graphs.

**Blockchain Systems** — I've touched governance infrastructure for ZKSync (150k+ daily RPC calls), worked with the Ethereum Foundation on zero-knowledge research (IVCNotes), and contributed to protocols like Superfluid, MakerDAO, Gnosis, and Lens Protocol. Not the sexy frontend stuff—the backend systems that keep things running.

**Developer Tools** — [Azul](https://github.com/0xSero/Azul) is a terminal-based web browser with AI tool-calling. [AI Data Extraction](https://github.com/0xSero/AI-Data-Extraction) helps developers reclaim their conversation history from AI coding assistants. [Synpress](https://synpress.io) contributions make Web3 e2e testing actually work with MetaMask.

**Protection Work** — I still help creators protect their digital presence. It's not scalable and it doesn't pay well, but someone has to do it.

## The Philosophy

I don't believe in move-fast-and-break-things when the things being broken are people's livelihoods, privacy, or autonomy.

I believe in:

- **Building in public** — 175+ repos, most of them open source
- **Freedom technology** — Systems that give individuals more control, not less
- **Boring reliability** — The best infrastructure is the kind you never think about
- **Saying no** — To projects that extract value without creating it

## Outside the Terminal

I host local meetups. I read too many books about systems thinking. I work out because sitting at a computer all day will kill you. I spend time with my family because nothing else matters as much as they pretend other things do.

I'm based in the US, but I've worked with teams across every timezone. I prefer async communication, clear requirements, and shipping over talking about shipping.

## Let's Work Together

I take on a limited number of client projects—usually infrastructure work that requires deep context and careful execution. If you're building something that gives people more freedom, more privacy, or more control over their digital lives, [let's talk](/contact).

If you're building another extractive platform, I'm not your guy.
